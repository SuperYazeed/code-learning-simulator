### 2. ✅ Common Mistakes Table (NEW Appendix Table)

**Added to Appendix Modal:**

| Language | Mistake | Why It Fails | Correct Way |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Python | age = "25" | Quotes make it text | age = 25 |
| Java | int age = 25 | Missing semicolon | int age = 25; |
| Python | print age | Python 3 needs () | print(age) |
| All | int class = 5 | Reserved keyword | int studentClass = 5 |
| Python | if x=5: | Assignment not comparison | if x==5: |
| Java | String name = Ali; | Missing quotes | String name = "Ali"; |
| C++ | cout << x | Missing namespace | std::cout << x |
| TypeScript | let age:number = "25" | Type mismatch | let age:number = 25 |
| All | int a, b = 5, 10 | Wrong syntax | int a = 5; int b = 10; |
| Python | def add(x,y) return x+y | Missing colon | def add(x,y): return x+y |

**Educational Value:**
- Prevents 10 most common beginner errors

## 🎯 Examples of Educational Content

### Multi-Variable Example Usage

**Student tries:** `"Name Sarah, age 20, GPA 3.8, enrolled true"` (Python)

**App generates:**
```python
age = 20
print(age)
gpa = 3.8
print(gpa)
# ... more variables
```

**Student sees:**
- ✅ Multiple variables in one description
- ✅ Different data types working together
- ✅ Real-world data modeling
- ✅ Practical application

### Common Mistakes Prevention

**Student might try:** `age = "25"` (Python)

**Appendix explains:**
- ❌ Mistake: `age = "25"`
- 🤔 Why it fails: Quotes make it text, not number
- ✅ Correct way: `age = 25`

**Result:** Student learns BEFORE making the error!

### Best Practices Application

**Student learns:**
- ✅ Python uses `snake_case` for variables
- ✅ Java uses `camelCase` for variables
- ✅ Constants are `ALL_CAPS` in all languages
- ✅ Use meaningful names, avoid `a`, `x`, `tmp`

**Result:** Professional code from day 1!
